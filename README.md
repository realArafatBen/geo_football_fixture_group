To handle json response and group items according to their cateogory they belong 
In this example am using live football fixture for this date 25th June, 2021 
API used is from https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/fixture endpoint in particular 
      
What brought about this issue what the fact that it was never documentated on how to used the api
and get fixture but this response should be grouped according to the leagues they belong to. But i 
was given the leagues for each fixture all i have to do was to find a way to group them by their leagues
